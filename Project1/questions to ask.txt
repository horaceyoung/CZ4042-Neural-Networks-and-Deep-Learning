Hi Kai Lin! Hope you are having a good day.
I do have some follow-up questions regarding the two options.
If I go with the intention to offer, when is the deadline for this and will it have a chance to be withdrawn under some circumstances?
And on the other hand if I decide to sign the contract with Shopee now, what would the timeline look like and when will the process start? Cause I'm at the end of the semester now and am quite coupled with deadlines and exams so I would prefer if the process can start after this semester ends.
Thanks and hope to hear from you soon!

Thanks!
